## Introduction

This repository originated from a [StackOverflow](https://web.archive.org/web/20140606191453/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194812/list-of-freely-available-programming-books/392926) post, with contributions from Karan Bhangui and George Stocker. It was migrated to GitHub by Victor Felder, and with the help of the community, it has grown into one of [GitHub's most popular repositories](https://octoverse.github.com/).

Managed by the [Free Ebook Foundation](https://ebookfoundation.org), this project is part of a not-for-profit initiative focused on promoting the creation, distribution, and sustainability of free ebooks. Donations to the foundation are [tax-deductible](https://ebookfoundation.org/contributions.html) in the US.
