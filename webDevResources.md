Web- Development

Back-end developers :

-designs the application APIs and databases schemas and implements the business logic. 
-Backend developers were originally referred to as developers back in the days when front-end development was considered to be trivial work.
-Backend developers can employ a wide range of languages to achieve their needs. 
-A backend developer would be skilled in languages such as PHP, Java, Python, ASP.net, Ruby, etc.


Front-end developers:

-Front-end developers consume the APIs and implement the logic to handle a website’s presentation, interactivity, and user experience. 
-Unlike backend, the front-end developer’s main scripting language is JavaScript.
-However, there is an overwhelming amount of JavaScript frameworks, libraries, bundlers, and build tools available for front-end development. 
-And oftentimes a front-end developer is specialised in one or more of these. Some examples of these front-end technologies are React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Webpack, Rollup, Snowpack, ESbuild, etc.
